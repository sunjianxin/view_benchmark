## View Benchmark: *Viewpoint Evaluation for SciVis Agent*

![results](https://github.com/sunjianxin/view_benchmark/blob/main/doc/teaser.png)

### Introduction
This work is the benchmark to evaluate the viewpoint of the visualization image generated by the SciVis agent. The view-dependent operation is implemented using VTK in C++.
   
### Build
1. Create project folder
```bash
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
```
2. Get mfa library, no need to build or install it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunjianxin/mfa
```
3. Install VTK_DVR-MFA based on VTK of verion 9.0.3.
    * Follow the instruction in [VTK_DVR-MFA](https://github.com/sunjianxin/VTK_MFA-DVR) repo.
4. Get and build example code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunjianxin/view_benchmark
cd vtk/SimpleRayCast
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..  \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx \
-DMFA_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_mfa_include_folder \
-DVTK_DIR:PATH=path_to_VTK_DVR-MFA_installation_folder
```
*path_to_mfa_include_folder* is the folder location in the project folder in step 2. *path_to_VTK_DVR-MFA_installation_folder* is the installation location when you configure VTK_DVR-MFA before building, and it is normally at */usr/local/include/vtk-9.0* by default.

### To Do
1. Impliment data-dependent operation through Computer Vision algorithms
2. Criteria of score
